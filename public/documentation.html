  <p>To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
    application will provide users with access to information about different
    movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
    personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Return a list of ALL movies to the user
    </li>
    <li>Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it’s featured or not) about a
      single movie by title to the user</li>
    <li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”)</li>
    <li>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</li>
    <li>Allow new users to register</li>
    <li>Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)

            <b>"Name"</b>: "David Lynch", <br>
            <b>"Biography"</b>: "Born in 1946 in Missoula, Montana, David Lynch was raised in small-town America. After
            high
            school, he went to Boston to attend the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Shortly after that, he planned a
            three-year trip to Europe to work on his art, but didn't take to it and left after 15 days. In 1977, he
            released his first film Eraserhead (1977), which, although not critically acclaimed, was noticed by many
            people, including Francis Ford Coppola, who was rumored to have screenings of it for his cast and crew on
            the
            Apocalypse Now (1979) set. After a stream of visually striking films such as Blue Velvet (1986), Lost
            Highway
            (1997) and Mulholland Drive (2001). These films and others, beginning with Blue Velvet (1986), and including
            his Twin Peaks (1990) T.V. series, feature what has now been added to signature Lynch features, such as
            vibrant colors, the use of dreams and montage to connect character thought and multiple emotions into one
            sequence. In addition to that, since Blue Velvet (1986), Lynch has gained the reputation of one of the
            foremost auteurs in the film industry, and one of the few living auteurs who continually defies cinematic
            convention. His films continually represent his ideal that films, representing life, should be complex, and
            in
            some cases, inexplicable. Due to his decisive innovation and the beautiful confusion of his films, he will
            always be recognized as if not one of the greatest film-makers, one of the most original. Lynch is an
            innovative director, and even if his films aren't necessarily realistic, they are real in their
            representation
            of what life is: a confusing, irrational series of events that have little purpose, and one makes one's own
            interpretation of each event, giving life one's own purpose. Lynch wants his films to resonate emotionally
            and
            instinctively, and for every person to relate and find its own understanding. As he said, 'Life is very,
            very
            confusing, and so films should be allowed to be, too'. David Lynch is original. He has done things in
            film-making that D.W. Griffith did in his day. David Lynch will never stop making beauty on the screen.",
